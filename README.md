# CS-305 Project one Artemis Financial.

•	1 Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and its software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did the company want you to address?
The client for this project is the fictitious company called Artemis Financial. They needed to have secure communications as they deal with high-end customers like the government.  They deal with sensitive data in regard to investments, savings and insurance.

• 2 What did you do well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall well-being? 
I think I did a good report on it through my word program template.

•	3 Which part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
I had a hard time with the whole process and only succeeded thanks to my teacher and looking at various sources on this platform.

•	4 How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
I only checked the security profile; I didn’t add more security to it.

•	5 How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities? 
I did a dependency check on it.

•	6 What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks? 
 I used the Eclipse IDE to modify the code, so that I could do a dependency check report.

•	7 Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?  
Honestly I have just switched my major out of this field and it is doubtful that I would need to show a prospective employer anything from this.  However, I do have this and a couple of other repositories here that I could show to say that I have some schooling in this kind of work.
